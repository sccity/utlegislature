The Division of Water Resources shall comply with Section

Utah Code Annotated - Title 73 - Chapter 10c - Water Development Coordinating Council

Utah Code Annotated § 73-10c-1 Legislative findings.
----------------------------------------------------
The Legislature finds that the conservation, development, treatment, restoration, and protection of the waters of this arid state are a state purpose and a matter of statewide concern. The needs and requirements associated with conserving, developing, treating, restoring, and protecting the waters of this state are of such magnitude and complexity that they justify state participation and assistance. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 United States Code Annotated Secs. 300f et seq. (federal drinking water act) establishes a national policy to ensure delivery of safe drinking water to the public, establishes maximum pollution levels, monitoring and reporting requirements and provides penalties, including the assessment of fines, for political subdivisions that violate the act. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Title 33, Chapter 26, United States Code (federal water pollution control act), establishes a national policy and program for the restoration, preservation, and protection of the nation's waters. The political subdivisions of this state are prohibited by the federal water pollution control act from polluting the navigable waters of the United States and are subject to various penalties, including the assessment of fines, for failing to meet the minimum standards of the federal water pollution control act. Pursuant to the requirements of the federal pollution control act, the state has established water quality standards and effluent limitations with respect to the waters of this state.  These standards and limitations have been adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the purpose of issuing permits for wastewater projects and the state must certify compliance with these standards and limitations in order for the federal permit to be obtained.  Under the federal water pollution control act, the state and its political subdivisions may receive grants, subject to the availability of funds, to meet the requirements of the federal water pollution control act if the state or its political subdivisions make contributions to the nonfederal share of construction costs of treatment works. It is desirable that the state assist in providing financing mechanisms to aid political subdivisions in securing needed water treatment and transporting water and in the acquisition and construction of drinking water projects and wastewater projects in order to accomplish the foregoing purposes, to protect the public health and welfare, to meet the anticipated growth in the state and to encourage development of the state's resources.

The acreage of each tract in proportion to the total unit acreage shall be the measure of relative value, unless the division finds after public hearing that another method is likely to result in a more equitable allocation and protection of correlative rights.  Resource temperature, pressure, fluid quality, geological conditions, distance to place of use, and productivity are among the factors that may be considered in evaluating other methods.  The method for allocating production in unit operations shall be revised, if, after a hearing, the division finds that the revised method is likely to result in a more equitable allocation and protection of correlative rights.  Any affected person may file a request for agency action to consider adoption of a revised allocation method, but the request may not be made until three years after the initial order by the division or at less than two-year intervals after that.

If the owners of the unit area are unable to agree upon the amount of the charges or to agree upon the correctness of the charges, any affected party may file a request for agency action.  Upon receipt of the request, the division shall hold a hearing to determine them.

Utah Code Annotated § 73-29-103 Declarations.
---------------------------------------------
The Legislature declares:Utah Code Annotated § 73-29-103(1): the Utah Constitution's specific private property protections, including recognition of the inalienable right to acquire, possess, and protect property and the prohibition on taking or damaging private property for public use without just compensation, protect against government's broad recognition or grant of a public recreation easement to access or use public water on private property;
Utah Code Annotated § 73-29-103(2): general constitutional and statutory provisions declaring public ownership of water and recognizing existing rights of use are insufficient to overcome the specific constitutional protections for private property and do not justify inviting widespread unauthorized invasion of private property for recreation purposes where public access has never existed or has not existed for a sufficient period and under the conditions required to support recognition under this chapter;
Utah Code Annotated § 73-29-103(3): whether, or to what extent, a public easement exists for recreational use of public waters on private property is uncertain after judicial decisions in the cases of J.J.N.P. Co. v. State, 655 P.2d 1133 (Utah 1982) and Conatser v. Johnson, 194 P.3d 897 (Utah 2008), which decisions did not address the constitutional prohibition on taking or damaging private property without just compensation;
Utah Code Annotated § 73-29-103(4): legislative failure to provide guidance before, coupled with legislative inaction after the 1982 decision in J.J.N.P. Co. v. State form a compelling foundation for the Legislature to affirm a limited right to float on the water without violating the constitutional protections of the underlying private property;
Utah Code Annotated § 73-29-103(5): the real and substantial invasion of private property rights did not occur with recognition of the right to float on water that passes over the land, but with the right, first recognized in Conatser v. Johnson, to physically occupy the land for an indeterminate time and for a wide range of activities by the public against the owner's will and without just compensation;
Utah Code Annotated § 73-29-103(6): its intent to foster restoration of the accommodation existing between recreational users and private property owners before the decision in Conatser v. Johnson, affirm a floating right recognized by the court in J.J.N.P. Co. v. State, and recognize adverse use as a constitutionally sound and manageable basis for establishing a limited right of public recreational access on private property in accordance with this chapter.
