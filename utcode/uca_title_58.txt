This act shall be known as the "Clandestine Drug Lab Act."

---------------------------------------
The clandestine production of methamphetamine, other amphetamines, phencyclidine, narcotic analgesic analogs, so-called "designer drugs," various hallucinogens, concentrated tetrahydrocannabinols, counterfeit opioids, cocaine and methamphetamine, base "crack" cocaine and methamphetamine "ice" respectively, has increased dramatically throughout the western states and Utah.  These highly technical illegal operations create substantial dangers to the general public and environment from fire, explosions, and the release of toxic chemicals.  By their very nature these activities often involve a number of persons in a conspiratorial enterprise to bring together all necessary components for clandestine production, to thwart regulation and detection, and to distribute the final product.  Therefore, the Legislature enacts the following Utah Clandestine Laboratory Act for prosecution of specific illegal laboratory operations.  With regard to the controlled substances specified herein, this act shall control, notwithstanding the prohibitions and penalties in

This chapter is known as the "Interstate Medical Licensure Compact."

Utah Code Annotated § 58-67b-102 Section 1 -- Purpose.
------------------------------------------------------
In order to strengthen access to health care, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards and provides a streamlined process that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients.  The Compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state's existing medical practice act.  The Compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter, and therefore, requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located.  State medical boards that participate in the Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a physician through the procedures in the Compact.

Utah Code Annotated § 58-70c-101 Section 1 -- Purpose.
------------------------------------------------------
In order to strengthen access to Medical Services, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of Medical Services, the Participating States of the PA Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of State Licensing Boards to license and discipline PAs and seeks to enhance the portability of a License to practice as a PA while safeguarding the safety of patients. This Compact allows Medical Services to be provided by PAs, via the mutual recognition of the Licensees Qualifying License by other Compact Participating States. This Compact also adopts the prevailing standard for PA licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of Medical Services by the PA occurs where the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter, and therefore requires the PA to be under the jurisdiction of the State Licensing Board where the patient is located. State Licensing Boards that participate in this Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose Adverse Action against a Compact Privilege in that State issued to a PA through the procedures of this Compact. The PA Licensure Compact will alleviate burdens for military families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain a Compact Privilege based on having an unrestricted License in good standing from a Participating State.
