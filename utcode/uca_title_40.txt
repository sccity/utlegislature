If the persons owning required percentage of interest in that unit area do not approve the plan for unit operations within a period of six months from the date on which the order providing for unit operations is made, the order shall be ineffective and shall be revoked by the board unless for good cause shown the board extends this time.
Utah Code Annotated § 40-6-8(5): An order providing for unit operations may be amended by an order made by the board in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as an original order providing for unit operations, provided:
Utah Code Annotated § 40-6-8(5)(a): If such an amendment affects only the rights and interests of the owners, the approval of the amendment by the owners of royalty, overriding royalty, production payments and other such interests which are free of costs shall not be required.
Utah Code Annotated § 40-6-8(5)(b): No such order of amendment shall change the percentage for the allocation of oil and gas as established for any separately owned tract by the original order, or change the percentage for allocation of cost as established for any separately owned tract by the original order.
Utah Code Annotated § 40-6-8(6): The board, by an order, may provide for the unit operation of a pool or pools or parts thereof that embrace a unit area established by a previous order of the division.  The order, in providing for the allocation of unit production, shall first treat the unit area previously established as a single tract, and the portion of the unit production allocated shall then be allocated among the separately owned tracts included in the previously established unit area in the same proportions of those specified in the previous order.

Utah Code Annotated § 40-6-8(8): All operations, including, but not limited to, the commencement, drilling, or operation of a well upon any portion of the unit area shall be deemed for all purposes the conduct of such operations upon each separately owned tract in the unit area by the several owners.  The portions of the unit production allocated to a separately owned tract in a unit area shall, when produced, be deemed, for all purposes, to have been actually produced from such tract by a well drilled.  Operations conducted pursuant to an order of the board providing for unit operations shall constitute a fulfillment of all the express or implied obligations for each lease or contract covering lands in the unit area to the extent that compliance with such obligations cannot be had because of the order of the board.
Utah Code Annotated § 40-6-8(9): The portion of the unit production allocated to any tract, and the proceeds from the sale, shall be the property and income of the several owners, subject to the rights of royalty owners, to whom, or to whose credit, they are allocated or payable under the order providing for unit operations.
Utah Code Annotated § 40-6-8(10): No division order or other contract relating to the sale or purchase of production from a separately owned tract shall be terminated by the order providing for unit operations but shall remain in force and apply to oil and gas allocated to such tract until terminated in accordance with the provisions thereof.

Utah Code Annotated - Title 40 - Chapter 10 - Coal Mining and Reclamation
*************************************************************************

Utah Code Annotated § 40-10-1 Legislative finding.
--------------------------------------------------
The Utah Legislature finds that:Utah Code Annotated § 40-10-1(1): Coal mining operations presently contribute significantly to the nation's energy requirements; surface coal mining constitutes one method of extraction of the resource; the overwhelming percentage of Utah's coal reserves can only be extracted by underground mining methods; and it is, therefore, essential to the national interest to insure the existence of an expanding and economically healthy underground coal mining industry.
Utah Code Annotated § 40-10-1(2): The expansion of coal mining in Utah to meet the nation's energy needs makes even more urgent the establishment of appropriate standards to minimize damage to the environment and to productivity of the soil and to protect the health and safety of the public.
Utah Code Annotated § 40-10-1(3): Surface mining and reclamation technology is now developed so that effective and reasonable regulation of surface coal mining operations is an appropriate and necessary means to minimize so far as practicable the adverse social, economic, and environmental effects of the mining operations.
Utah Code Annotated § 40-10-1(4): In recognition of the innate differences between coal and other mineral deposits and between surface and underground mining methods, the Legislature perceives a need for a separate chapter for effective and reasonable regulation of such operations.


Utah Code Annotated § 40-10-2 Purpose.
--------------------------------------
It is the purpose of this chapter to:Utah Code Annotated § 40-10-2(1): grant to the Board and Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining the necessary authority to assure exclusive jurisdiction over nonfederal lands and cooperative jurisdiction over federal lands in regard to regulation of coal mining and reclamation operations as authorized pursuant to Public Law 95-87;
Utah Code Annotated § 40-10-2(2): assure that the rights of surface landowners and other persons with a legal interest in the land or appurtenances thereto are fully protected from these operations;
Utah Code Annotated § 40-10-2(3): assure that surface coal mining operations are conducted so as to protect the environment, that reclamation occurs as contemporaneously as possible with the operations, and that operations are not conducted where reclamation as required by this chapter is not economically or technologically feasible;
Utah Code Annotated § 40-10-2(4): assure that appropriate procedures are provided for the public participation in the development, revision, and enforcement of rules, standards, reclamation plans, or programs established by the state under this chapter;
Utah Code Annotated § 40-10-2(5): promote the reclamation of mined areas left without adequate reclamation prior to the effective date of this chapter and which continue, in their unreclaimed condition, to substantially degrade the quality of the environment, prevent or damage the beneficial use of land or water resources, or endanger the health or safety of the public; and
Utah Code Annotated § 40-10-2(6): wherever necessary, exercise the full reach of state constitutional powers to insure the protection of the public interest through effective control of surface coal mining operations and efficient reclamation of abandoned mines.
