Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201 Rights of parents -- Children's rights -- Interest and responsibility of state.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1): (2); (7); (1)
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(a): Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, a parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of the parent's children. A fundamentally fair process must be provided to parents if the state moves to challenge or interfere with parental rights. A governmental entity must support any actions or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent's child by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent's constitutional entitlement to heightened protection against government interference with the parent's fundamental rights and liberty interests and, concomitantly, the right of the child to be reared by the child's natural parent.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(b): The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care, custody, and management of the parent's child is recognized, protected, and does not cease to exist simply because a parent may fail to be a model parent or because the parent's child is placed in the temporary custody of the state. At all times, a parent retains a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of family life. Before an adjudication of unfitness, government action in relation to a parent and the parent's child may not exceed the least restrictive means or alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest. Until the state proves parental unfitness, and the child suffers, or is substantially likely to suffer, serious detriment as a result, the child and the child's parent share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationship and the state cannot presume that a child and the child's parent are adversaries.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(c): It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and supervision of the child's natural parents. A child's need for a normal family life in a permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family relationships is usually best met by the child's natural parents. Additionally, the integrity of the family unit and the right of a parent to conceive and raise the parent's child are constitutionally protected. The right of a fit, competent parent to raise the parent's child without undue government interference is a fundamental liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution and is a fundamental public policy of this state.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(d): The state recognizes that:
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(d)(i): a parent has the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to raise, manage, train, educate, provide and care for, and reasonably discipline the parent's child; and
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(d)(ii): the state's role is secondary and supportive to the primary role of a parent.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(e): It is the public policy of this state that:
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(e)(i): a parent retains the fundamental right and duty to exercise primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of the parent's child;
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(e)(ii): a parent retains the right to have contact with the parent's child when the child is placed outside of the parent's home, and parent-time should be ordered by a court so long as the contact is not contrary to the best interest of the child; and

Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-103(2): The juvenile court shall:
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-103(2)(a): in all cases filed under this chapter require the petitioner to establish the facts by clear and convincing evidence;
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-103(2)(b): give full and careful consideration to all of the evidence presented with regard to the constitutional rights and claims of the parent; and
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-103(2)(c): if a parent is found, by reason of the parent's conduct or condition, to be unfit or incompetent based upon any of the grounds for termination described in this chapter, consider the welfare and best interest of the child of paramount importance in determining whether to terminate parental rights.


Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104 Judicial process for termination -- Parent unfit or incompetent -- Best interest of child.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(1): Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, a parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of the parent's child.  For this reason, the termination of family ties by the state may only be done for compelling reasons.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(2): The juvenile court shall provide a fundamentally fair process to a parent if a party moves to terminate the parent's parental rights.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(3): If the party moving to terminate parental rights is a governmental entity, the juvenile court shall find that any actions or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent's child are supported by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent's constitutional entitlement to heightened protection against government interference with the parent's fundamental rights and liberty interests.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(4): 
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(4)(a): The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care, custody, and management of the parent's child is recognized, protected, and does not cease to exist simply because:
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(4)(a)(i): a parent may fail to be a model parent; or
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(4)(a)(ii): the parent's child is placed in the temporary custody of the state.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(4)(b): The juvenile court should give serious consideration to the fundamental right of a parent to rear the parent's child, and concomitantly, of the right of the child to be reared by the child's natural parent.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(5): At all times, a parent retains a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of family life.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(6): Before an adjudication of unfitness, government action in relation to a parent and a parent's child may not exceed the least restrictive means or alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(7): Until parental unfitness is established and the children suffer, or are substantially likely to suffer, serious detriment as a result, the child and the child's parent share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their relationship and the juvenile court may not presume that a child and the child's parents are adversaries.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(8): It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and supervision of the child's natural parents. A child's need for a normal family life in a permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family relationships is usually best met by the child's natural parents. Additionally, the integrity of the family unit and the right of parents to conceive and raise their children are constitutionally protected. For these reasons, the juvenile court should only transfer custody of a child from the child's natural parent for compelling reasons and when there is a jurisdictional basis to do so.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(9): The right of a fit, competent parent to raise the parent's child without undue government interference is a fundamental liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution of this state and of the United States, and is a fundamental public policy of this state.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(10): 
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(10)(a): The state recognizes that:
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(10)(a)(i): a parent has the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to raise, manage, train, educate, provide for, and reasonably discipline the parent's child; and
