Utah Code Annotated § 70A-1a-308(1): A party that with explicit reservation of rights performs or promises performance or assents to performance in a manner demanded or offered by the other party does not thereby prejudice the rights reserved.  Such words as "without prejudice," "under protest," or the like are sufficient.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-1a-308(2): (1) Subsection


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-1a-309 Option to accelerate at will.
--------------------------------------------------------------
A term providing that one party or that party's successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral "at will" or when the party "considers itself insecure," or words of similar import, means that the party has power to do so only if that party in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired.  The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against which the power has been exercised.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-1a-310 Subordinated obligations.
----------------------------------------------------------
An obligation may be issued as subordinated to performance of another obligation of the person obligated, or a creditor may subordinate its right to performance of an obligation by agreement with either the person obligated or another creditor of the person obligated.  Subordination does not create a security interest as against either the common debtor or a subordinated creditor.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-105(4): An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-106(1): 70A-2-401 In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires "contract" and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-106(3): "Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On "termination" all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-106(4): "Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of "termination" except that the canceling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-107(1): A contract for the sale of minerals or the like (including oil or gas) or a structure or its materials to be removed from realty is a contract for the sale of goods within this chapter if they are to be severed by the seller but until severance a purported present sale thereof which is not effective as a transfer of an interest in land is effective only as a contract to sell.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-107(2): (1) A contract for the sale apart from the land of growing crops or other things attached to realty and capable of severance without material harm thereto but not described in Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-107(3): The provisions of this section are subject to any third- party rights provided by the law relating to realty records, and the contract for sale may be executed and recorded as a document transferring an interest in land and shall then constitute notice to third parties of the buyer's rights under the contract for sale.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-201 Formal requirements -- Statute of frauds.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-201(1): Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker. A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this paragraph beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-201(2): (1) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-201(3): (1); 70A-2-606 A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-201(3)(a): if the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-201(3)(b): if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-201(3)(c): 70A-2-606 with respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted (Section


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-202 Final written expression -- Parol or extrinsic evidence.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented:Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-202(1): 70A-1a-303; 70A-2-208 by course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade (Section
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-202(2): by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-203 Seals inoperative.
--------------------------------------------------
The affixing of a seal to a writing evidencing a contract for sale or an offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the writing a sealed instrument and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not apply to such a contract or offer.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-204 Formation in general.
-----------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-204(1): A contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-204(2): An agreement sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even though the moment of its making is undetermined.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-204(3): Even though one or more terms are left open a contract for sale does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-205 Firm offers.
--------------------------------------------
An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed three months; but any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-206 Offer and acceptance in formation of contract.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-206(1): Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-206(1)(b): an order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of nonconforming goods, but such a shipment of nonconforming goods does not constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-206(2): Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-207 Additional terms in acceptance or confirmation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-207(1): A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-207(2): The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless:
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-207(2)(a): the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-207(2)(b): they materially alter it; or
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-207(2)(c): notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-207(3): Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this act.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-208 Course of performance or practical construction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-208(1): Where the contract for sale involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other, any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-208(2): 70A-1a-303 The express terms of the agreement and any such course of performance, as well as any course of dealing and usage of trade, shall be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other; but when such construction is unreasonable, express terms shall control course of performance and course of performance shall control both course of dealing and usage of trade (Section
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-208(3): Subject to the provisions of the next section on modification and waiver, such course of performance shall be relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with such course of performance.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-209 Modification, rescission and waiver.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-209(1): An agreement modifying a contract within this chapter needs no consideration to be binding.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-209(2): A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a requirement on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the other party.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-209(3): 70A-2-201 The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this chapter (Section
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-209(4): (2); (3) Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-209(5): A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-210 Delegation of performance -- Assignment of rights.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-210(1): A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-210(2): 70A-9a-406 Except as otherwise provided in Section
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-210(3): (2) The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-210(3)(a): the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer; and
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-210(3)(b): a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-210(4): Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of "the contract" is to be construed as barring only the delegation of (to) the assignee of the assignor's performance.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-210(5): An assignment of "the contract" or of "all my rights under the contract" or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment of (for) security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-210(6): 70A-2-609 The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (Section

---------------------------------------------------------------
The obligation of the seller is to transfer and deliver and that of the buyer is to accept and pay in accordance with the contract.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-302(1): If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-302(2): When it is claimed or appears to the court that the contract or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in making the determination.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-303 Allocation or division of risks.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Where this chapter allocates a risk or a burden as between the parties "unless otherwise agreed," the agreement may not only shift the allocation but may also divide the risk or burden.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-304(1): The price can be made payable in money or otherwise. If it is payable in whole or in part in goods each party is a seller of the goods which he is to transfer.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-304(2): Even though all or part of the price is payable in an interest in realty the transfer of the goods and the seller's obligations with reference to them are subject to this chapter, but not the transfer of the interest in realty or the transferor's obligations in connection therewith.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-305 Open price term.
------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-305(1): The parties if they so intend can conclude a contract for sale even though the price is not settled. In such a case the price is a reasonable price at the time for delivery if
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-305(1)(a): nothing is said as to price; or
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-305(1)(b): the price is left to be agreed by the parties and they fail to agree; or
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-305(1)(c): the price is to be fixed in terms of some agreed market or other standard as set or recorded by a third person or agency and it is not so set or recorded.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-305(2): A price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer means a price for him to fix in good faith.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-305(3): When a price left to be fixed otherwise than by agreement of the parties fails to be fixed through fault of one party the other may at his option treat the contract as canceled or himself fix a reasonable price.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-305(4): Where, however, the parties intend not to be bound unless the price be fixed or agreed and it is not fixed or agreed there is no contract. In such a case the buyer must return any goods already received or if unable so to do must pay their reasonable value at the time of delivery and the seller must return any portion of the price paid on account.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-306 Output, requirements and exclusive dealings.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-306(1): A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer means such actual output or requirements as may occur in good faith, except that no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the absence of a stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements may be tendered or demanded.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-306(2): A lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned imposes unless otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to use best efforts to supply the goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-307 Delivery in single lot or several lots.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Unless otherwise agreed all goods called for by a contract for sale must be tendered in a single delivery and payment is due only on such tender but where the circumstances give either party the right to make or demand delivery in lots the price if it can be apportioned may be demanded for each lot.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-308 Absence of specified place for delivery.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unless otherwise agreed:Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-308(1): the place for delivery of goods is the seller's place of business or if he has none his residence; but

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2a-215(2): A sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description.

This section does not displace principles of law and equity that extend a warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee to other persons.  The operation of this section may not be excluded, modified, or limited, but an exclusion, modification, or limitation of the warranty, including any with respect to rights and remedies, effective against the lessee is also effective against any beneficiary designated under this section.

Acceptance by the transferee constitutes a promise by  the transferee to perform those duties.   The promise is enforceable by either the transferor or the other party to the lease contract.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2a-303(6): Unless otherwise agreed by the lessor and the lessee, a delegation of performance does not relieve the  transferor as against the other party of any duty to perform or any liability for default.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2a-308(2): Nothing in this chapter impairs the rights of creditors of a lessor if the lease contract is made under circumstances which under any statute or rule of law apart from the chapter would constitute the transaction a voidable transaction or voidable preference.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-203(1): An instrument is transferred when it is delivered by a person other than its issuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-203(2): Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the transfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, including any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due course by a transfer, directly or indirectly, from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or illegality affecting the instrument.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-203(3): Unless otherwise agreed, if an instrument is transferred for value and the transferee does not become a holder because of lack of indorsement by the transferor, the transferee has a specifically enforceable right to the unqualified indorsement of the transferor, but negotiation of the instrument does not occur until the indorsement is made.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-203(4): If a transferor purports to transfer less than the entire instrument, negotiation of the instrument does not occur. The transferee obtains no rights under this chapter and has only the rights of a partial assignee.

For the purpose of determining whether a signature is made on an instrument, a paper affixed to the instrument is a part of the instrument.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-204(3): For the purpose of determining whether the transferee of an instrument is a holder, an indorsement that transfers a security interest in the instrument is effective as an unqualified indorsement of the instrument.

When specially indorsed, an instrument becomes payable to the identified person and may be negotiated only by the indorsement of that person.  The principles stated in Section
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-205(2): If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument and it is not a special indorsement, it is a "blank indorsement." When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially indorsed.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-205(3): The holder may convert a blank indorsement that consists only of a signature into a special indorsement by writing, above the signature of the indorser, words identifying the person to whom the instrument is made payable.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-205(4): "Anomalous indorsement" means an indorsement made by a person who is not the holder of the instrument.  An anomalous indorsement does not affect the manner in which the instrument may be negotiated.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-206 Restrictive indorsement.
--------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-206(1): An indorsement limiting payment to a particular person or otherwise prohibiting further transfer or negotiation of the instrument is not effective to prevent further transfer or negotiation of the instrument.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-206(2): An indorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect the right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument.  A person paying the instrument or taking it for value or collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person are not affected by whether the condition has been fulfilled.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-206(3): 70A-4-201(2); (3)(c) If an instrument bears an indorsement described in Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-206(3)(a): A person, other than a bank, who purchases the instrument when so indorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid for the instrument is received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-206(3)(c): A payor bank that is also the depositary bank or that takes the instrument for immediate payment over the counter from a person other than a collecting bank converts the instrument unless the proceeds of the instrument are received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-206(4)(b): A subsequent transferee of the instrument or person who pays the instrument is neither given notice nor otherwise affected by the restriction in the indorsement unless the transferee or payor knows that the fiduciary dealt with the instrument or its proceeds in breach of fiduciary duty.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-206(5): (3); (4) The presence on an instrument of an indorsement to which this section applies does not prevent a purchaser of the instrument from becoming a holder in due course of the instrument unless the purchaser is a converter under Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-206(6): In an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the obligor has a defense if payment would violate an indorsement to which this section applies and the payment is not permitted by this section.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-3-207 Reacquisition.
----------------------------------------------
Reacquisition of an instrument occurs if it is transferred to a former holder, by negotiation or otherwise.  A former holder who reacquires the instrument may cancel indorsements made after the reacquirer first became a holder of the instrument.  If the cancellation causes the instrument to be payable to the reacquirer or to bearer, the reacquirer may negotiate the instrument.  An indorser whose indorsement is canceled is discharged, and the discharge is effective against any subsequent holder.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-201 Security procedure.
----------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-201(1): "Security procedure" means a procedure established by agreement of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of:
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-201(1)(a): verifying that a payment order or communication amending or canceling a payment order is that of the customer; or
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-201(1)(b): detecting error in the transmission or the content of the payment order or communication.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-201(2): A security procedure may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.  Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the customer is not by itself a security procedure.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-202 Authorized and verified payment orders.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-202(1): A payment order received by the receiving bank is the authorized order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is otherwise bound by it under the law of agency.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-202(2): 
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-202(2)(a): If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if:
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-202(2)(a)(i): the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment orders; and
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-202(2)(a)(ii): the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the security procedure and any written agreement or instruction of the customer restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-202(2)(b): The bank is not required to follow an instruction that violates a written agreement with the customer or notice of which is not received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the payment order is accepted.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-202(3): Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated.  A security procedure is considered to be commercially reasonable if:
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-202(3)(a): the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer; and
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-202(3)(b): the customer expressly agreed in writing to be bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name, and accepted by the bank in compliance with the security procedure chosen by the customer.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-202(4): (1); (2) The term "sender" in this chapter includes the customer in whose name a payment order is issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under Subsection

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-203(3): 
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-203(3)(a): The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order if the customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by:
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-203(3)(a)(i): a person entrusted at any time with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or the security procedure; or
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-203(3)(a)(ii): a person who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source controlled by the customer and without authority of the receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the security procedure, regardless of how the information was obtained or whether the customer was at fault.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a payment order addressed to a receiving bank is transmitted to a funds transfer system or other third-party communication system for transmittal to the bank, the system is deemed to be an agent of the sender for the purpose of transmitting the payment order to the bank.  If there is a discrepancy between the terms of the payment order transmitted to the system and the terms of the payment order transmitted by the system to the bank, the terms of the payment order of the sender are those transmitted by the system.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-208(2)(b): (2)(a) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by Subsection

The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-208(2)(d): 70A-4a-302(1)(a) If the receiving bank knows that the name and number identify different persons, reliance on either the name or the number in executing the sender's payment order is a breach of the obligation stated in Subsection

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-209(2)(e): If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest payable is reduced accordingly.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-210 Rejection of payment order.
------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-210(1): A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing.  A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order.  Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances.  If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not commercially reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice is received.  If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the means to be used to reject a payment order:
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-210(1)(a): any means complying with the agreement is commercially reasonable; and
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-210(1)(b): any means not complying is not commercially reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-210(2): 70A-4a-211 This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender sufficient to cover the order.  If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to Section
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-210(3): If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted payment orders issued to the bank are deemed rejected at the time the bank suspends payments.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-210(4): Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later rejection of the order.  Rejection of a payment order precludes a later acceptance of the order.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211 Cancellation and amendment of payment order.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211(1): A communication of the sender of a payment order canceling or amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally, electronically, or in writing.  If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211(2): (1) Subject to Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211(3): After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order is not effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank:
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211(3)(a): With respect to a payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation or amendment of the payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211(3)(b): With respect to a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized payment order, or because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer which resulted in the issuance of a payment order:
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211(3)(b)(i): that is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the sender;
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211(3)(b)(ii): that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the originator; or
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211(3)(b)(iii): that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled to receive from the originator.  If the payment order is canceled or amended, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211(4): An unaccepted payment order is canceled by operation of law at the close of the fifth funds transfer business day of the receiving bank after the execution date or payment date of the order.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211(5): A canceled payment order cannot be accepted.  If an accepted payment order is canceled, the acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance.  Amendment of a payment order is deemed to be cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and issue of a new payment order in the amended form at the same time.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211(6): Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds transfer system rule, if the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or amendment of the order by the sender or is bound by a funds transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without the bank's agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the bank as a result of the cancellation or amendment or attempted cancellation or amendment.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211(7): A payment order is not revoked by death or legal incapacity of the sender unless the receiving bank knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of competent jurisdiction and has reasonable opportunity to act before acceptance of the order.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-211(8): (3)(b) A funds transfer system rule is not effective to the extent it conflicts with Subsection


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-212 Liability and duty of receiving bank regarding unaccepted payment order.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a receiving bank fails to accept a payment order that it is obliged by express agreement to accept, the bank is liable for breach of the agreement to the extent as provided in the agreement or in this chapter, but does not otherwise have any duty to accept a payment order or, before acceptance, to take any action, or refrain from taking action, with respect to the order except as provided in this chapter or by express agreement.  Liability based on acceptance arises only when acceptance occurs as stated in Section

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-301 "Execution" and "execution date."
------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-301(1): A payment order is "executed" by the receiving bank when it issues a payment order intended to carry out the payment order received by the bank.  A payment order received by the beneficiary's bank can be accepted but cannot be executed.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-301(2): "Execution date" of a payment order means the day on which the receiving bank may properly issue a payment order in execution of the sender's order.  The execution date can be determined by instruction of the sender but cannot be earlier than the day the order is received and, unless otherwise determined, is the day the order is received.  If the sender's instruction states a payment date, the execution date is the payment date or an earlier date on which execution is reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date.


Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-302 Obligations of receiving bank in execution of payment order.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-302(1): (2); (4); 70A-4a-209(1) Except as provided in Subsections
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-4a-302(1)(a): The receiving bank is obliged to issue, on the execution date, a payment order complying with the sender's order and to follow the sender's instructions concerning any intermediary bank or funds transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer, or the means by which payment orders are to be transmitted in the funds transfer.

If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouse.  However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated, a warehouse's lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-7a-301(4): The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words "shipper's weight, load, and count," or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded by the shipper, and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by the improper loading.

The notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale.  The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The carrier sells goods in a commercially reasonable manner if the carrier sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold.  A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-7a-308(2): Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this section.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-7a-308(6): The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against a debtor.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-7a-308(7): (1); 70A-7a-210(2) A carrier's lien may be enforced pursuant to either Subsection

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whether a document of title is adequate to fulfill the obligations of a contract for sale, a contract for lease, or the conditions of a letter of credit is determined by

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-7a-601(1): (1) If a document of title is lost, stolen, or destroyed, a court may order delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute document and the bailee may without liability to any person comply with the order.  If the document was negotiable, a court may not order delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute document without the claimant's posting security unless it finds that any person that may suffer loss as a result of nonsurrender of possession or control of the document is adequately protected against the loss.  If the document was nonnegotiable, the court may require security.  The court may also order payment of the bailee's reasonable costs and attorney's fees in any action under this Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-7a-601(2): A bailee that, without a court order, delivers goods to a person claiming under a missing negotiable document of title is liable to any person injured thereby.  If the delivery is not in good faith, the bailee is liable for conversion.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-7a-602 Judicial process against goods covered by negotiable document of title.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unless a document of title was originally issued upon delivery of the goods by a person that did not have power to dispose of them, a lien does not attach by virtue of any judicial process to goods in the possession of a bailee for which a negotiable document of title is outstanding unless possession or control of the document is first surrendered to the bailee or the document's negotiation is enjoined.  The bailee may not be compelled to deliver the goods pursuant to process until possession or control of the document is surrendered to the bailee or to the court.  A purchaser of the document for value without notice of the process or injunction takes free of the lien imposed by judicial process.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-7a-603 Conflicting claims -- Interpleader.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If more than one person claims title to or possession of the goods, the bailee is excused from delivery until the bailee has a reasonable time to ascertain the validity of the adverse claims or to commence an action for interpleader.  The bailee may assert an interpleader either in defending an action for nondelivery of the goods or by original action.

Utah Code Annotated § 70A-7a-701 Applicability.

This chapter applies to a document of title that is issued or a bailment that arises on or after May 1, 2006.
