-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(1): (1)(b)
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(1)(a): No statement, representation, or warranty made by any person representing the insurer in the negotiation for an individual or franchise insurance contract affects the insurer's obligations under the policy unless it is stated in the policy or in a written application signed by the applicant.  No person, except the applicant or another by his written consent, may alter the application, except for administrative purposes in a way which is clearly not ascribable to the applicant.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(1)(b): No statement, representation, or warranty made by or on behalf of a particular certificate holder under a group policy affects the insurer's obligations under the certificate unless it is stated in the certificate or in a written document signed by the certificate holder, and a copy of it is supplied to the certificate holder.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(1)(c): (1)(b) The policyholder, his assignee, the loss payee or mortgagee or lienholder under property insurance, and any person whose life or health is insured under a policy may request, in writing, from the company a copy of the application, if he did not receive the policy or a copy of it, or if the policy has been reinstated or renewed without the attachment of a copy of the original application.  If the insurer does not deliver or mail a copy as requested within 30 days after receipt of the request by the insurer or its agent, or in the case of a group policy certificate holder, does not inform that person within the same period how he may inspect the policy or a copy of it and application or enrollment card or a copy of it during normal business hours at a place reasonably convenient to the certificate holder, nothing in the application or enrollment card affects the insurer's obligations under the policy to the person making the request.  Each person whose life or health is insured under a group policy has the same right to request a copy of any document under Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(2): (5) Except as provided in Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(2)(a): the insurer relies on it and it is either material or is made with intent to deceive; or
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(2)(b): the fact misrepresented or falsely warranted contributes to the loss.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(3): (3) No failure of a condition prior to the loss and no breach of a promissory warranty affects the insurer's obligations under the policy unless it exists at the time of the loss and either increases the risk at the time of the loss or contributes to the loss.  This Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(4): Nondisclosure of information not requested by the insurer is not a defense to an action against the insurer.  Failure to correct within a reasonable time any representation that becomes incorrect because of changes in circumstances is misrepresentation, not nondisclosure.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(5): (5) If after issuance of a policy the insurer acquires knowledge of sufficient facts to constitute a general defense to all claims under the policy, the defense is only available if the insurer notifies the insured within 60 days after acquiring the knowledge of its intention to defend against a claim if one should arise, or within 120 days if the insurer considers it necessary to secure additional medical information and is actively seeking the information at the end of the 60 days. The insurer and insured may mutually agree to a policy rider in order to continue the policy in force with exceptions or modifications.  For purposes of this Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(6): (6)(a); 31A-30-106

Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(6)(b)(i): in the absence of misrepresentation a different rate would have been required; and
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(6)(b)(ii): 31A-30-106 the corrected rates are in compliance with Section
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-105(7): No trivial or transitory breach of or noncompliance with any provision of this chapter is a basis for avoiding an insurance contract.

Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-305 Cancellation upon request of a premium finance company.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-305(1): As used in this section:
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-305(1)(a): "Insurance premium finance company" means a person engaged in the business of entering into premium finance agreements.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-305(1)(b): "Premium finance agreement" means an agreement by which an insured or prospective insured promises to pay to an insurance premium finance company the amount advanced or to be advanced under the agreement to an insurer or to an insurance producer in payment of premiums on an insurance policy, together with a service charge, an interest charge, or both.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-305(2): When a premium finance agreement contains a power of attorney or other authority enabling the insurance premium finance company to cancel any insurance policy listed in the agreement, the following applies:
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-305(2)(a): Not less than 10 days' written notice of the intent of the insurance premium finance company to order cancellation of the insurance policy, unless the policyholder's default is cured prior to the date stated in the notice, shall be delivered or mailed first-class to the policyholder.  The insurance producer indicated on the premium finance agreement shall also be given the same notice.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-305(2)(b): Pursuant to the power of attorney or other authority, evidence of which is delivered to the insurer, the insurance premium finance company may order cancellation on behalf of the insured.  This cancellation shall be effected by mailing to the insurer a written notice stating when the cancellation is effective.  The insurance policy shall be cancelled as if the notice of cancellation had been given by the insured, but without requiring the return of the insurance policy.  The insurance premium finance company shall also send a copy of the same notice to the insured at his last known address and to the insurance producer indicated on the premium finance agreement.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-305(2)(c): Where statutory, rule, or contractual restrictions provide that the insurance policy may not be cancelled unless notice is given to a governmental agency, mortgagee, or other third party, the insurer shall give the prescribed notice on behalf of itself or the insured to that governmental agency, mortgagee, or other third party within a reasonable time after the day it receives the notice of cancellation from the premium finance company.  When any statutory, rule, or contractual restrictions require the continuation of insurance beyond the effective date of cancellation specified by the premium finance company, the insurance is limited to the coverage required by those restrictions and to the persons those restrictions are designed to protect.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-305(2)(d): Whenever a financed insurance policy is cancelled, the insurer shall return any unearned premiums due under the insurance policy to the insurance premium finance company for the account of the insured, and this action by the insurer satisfies the insurer's obligations under the insurance policy which relate to the return of unearned premiums. If the crediting of return premiums to the account of the insured results in a surplus over the amount due from the insured, the premium finance company shall refund that excess to the insured if it exceeds $5.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-305(3): No filing of the premium finance agreement or recording of a premium finance transaction is necessary to perfect the validity of the agreement as a secured transaction as against creditors, subsequent purchasers, pledgees, encumbrancers, successors, or assigns.


Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-306 Policies or surety bonds jointly issued.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two or more insurers may together issue a policy or surety bond.  Their liability shall be joint and several with respect to the policy or bond.  The policy or bond shall state the proportion or amount of premium to be paid to each insurer and, as between the issuing insurers, the type and the proportion or amount of liability each insurer assumes.  Service of process on any of the insurers is service on all of them.

Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-307 Other insurance.
-------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-307(1): When two or more policies promise to indemnify an insured against the same loss without intending cumulative coverage, no "other insurance" provisions of the policies may reduce the aggregate protection of the insured below the lesser of the actual insured loss suffered by the insured and the maximum indemnification promised by any policy without regard to any "other insurance" provision.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-307(2): (1) Subject to Subsection

If the policy covers various risks, different limitations may be provided separately for each risk, if the policy clearly states that.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-308(2): A policy indemnifying an insured against loss of or damage to property may limit the part of the loss to be paid by the insurer to a percentage of the total loss that corresponds to the ratio of the insured sum to a specified percentage of the value of the insured property.


Utah Code Annotated § 31A-21-309 Nonwaiver clause.
--------------------------------------------------
An insurer may insert a provision in any insurance policy that no change in the policy is valid unless approved by an executive officer of the insurer, or unless the approval is endorsed on the policy or attached to it, or both, and that no agent has authority to change the policy or waive any of its provisions.  This does not preclude a person claiming a right under the policy from relying on waiver or estoppel in an appropriate case.

Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-101 Scope of part.
-----------------------------------------------
This

Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-102 Bonds need not be under seal.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Under this code, no suretyship obligation is required to be under seal.

Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-103 Validity of surety bonds.
----------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-103(1): An undertaking to stand as surety which is issued by an insurer authorized to do a surety business in this state is complete compliance with any qualification requirement in Utah law respecting surety bonds.  This undertaking is acceptable to any state official or court-appointed fiduciary authorized to receive or empowered to require the undertaking.  A copy of a surety's certificate of authority, certified by the commissioner, is prima facie evidence that a surety was authorized to do business in this state on the date of the certificate.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-103(2): No instrument executed by an insurer authorized to do a surety business is ineffective because of the insurer's failure to attach a copy of its certificate of authority to do business in this state.  However, a public official or court-appointed fiduciary may, by prior written request, require that a copy of the insurer's certificate of authority, certified by the commissioner, be delivered.  The insurer's failure to deliver a certified copy of the surety's certificate of authority within 10 days of receipt of the request is adequate grounds for refusing to accept the suretyship instrument.  Failure to request a copy of the certificate of authority prior to accepting the surety instrument is a waiver of the right to request the certificate.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-103(3): After executing an obligation of suretyship, no insurer may deny its corporate power to execute that type of instrument or to incur that type of liability in any proceeding against the insurer upon that instrument.


Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-104 Indemnity agreements and security for benefit of surety.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-104(1): Any insurer authorized to do a surety business may contract with any person, including a principal debtor under a suretyship obligation, for indemnity or security to protect the surety against losses.   No indemnity agreement or provision of security by the principal debtor releases from or changes the liability of the principal debtor or of the sureties from the terms established in the bond.  No surety may be indemnified through funds held by the principal debtor in a fiduciary capacity.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-104(2): Security may be in any of the following forms:
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-104(2)(a): deposits of money or other property of the principal debtor which can be held by a responsible financial institution authorized by law to do that type of business, in a manner that prevents withdrawal or alienation of the money or other property without the written consent of the sureties or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction made after notice is given to the sureties and a hearing is held as directed by the court; or
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-104(2)(b): security interests in real or personal property perfected under the laws of Utah.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-104(3): This section does not affect a surety's common-law right to reimbursement, subrogation, or exoneration.


Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-105 Common control of fiduciary funds permissible.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any fiduciary from whom a bond, undertaking, or other obligation is required may agree and arrange with his sureties for the deposit for safekeeping of any and all assets for which he is responsible with a depository institution authorized by law to hold the assets, in a manner which prevents the withdrawal or alienation of any part of the property without the written consent of the sureties, or an order of the court made after notice is given to the sureties and a hearing is held as directed by the court.  This deposit agreement does not release or change the fiduciary responsibility of the principal, or the liability of the principal or sureties as established under the bond.

Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-106 Petition of fiduciary's surety to be relieved from liability.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any surety securing others against losses caused by breach of duty by a fiduciary, herein called "principal," may petition the court where the surety's obligation is filed or which has jurisdiction over the principal, for an order relieving the surety from further liability for the acts or omissions of the principal.  This order may be issued only after the court is satisfied that the principal has accounted to the petitioner and has obtained a new surety.  The surety relieved from liability shall refund any unearned part of the premium paid which the surety held as consideration for its promise to be surety. To relieve a surety from liability, the court may order the principal to account, to obtain a new surety, or to refrain from acting except to preserve property held in a fiduciary capacity.

Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-107 Bond premium allowable expense of fiduciary.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any fiduciary required by law, or the court in providing a surety to secure the fiduciary's performance, may include as part of the expense of executing the fiduciary responsibility a reasonable premium paid to a surety for becoming the fiduciary's surety.  However, the court may not allow an expense allowance greater than the larger of 1% of the surety's maximum obligation or $25.

Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-201 Required provisions of liability insurance policies.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every liability insurance policy shall provide that the bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured may not diminish any liability of the insurer to third parties, and that if execution against the insured is returned unsatisfied, an action may be maintained against the insurer to the extent that the liability is covered by the policy.

Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-202 Protection of third-party claimants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-202(1): An insurance contract insuring against loss or damage through legal liability for the bodily injury or death by accident of any person, or for damage to the property of any person, may not be retroactively abrogated to the detriment of any third-party claimant by any agreement between the insurer and insured after the occurrence of any injury, death, or damage for which the insured may be liable.  This attempted abrogation is void.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-202(2): A motor vehicle liability policy may be rescinded or cancelled as to an insured for fraud, material misrepresentation, or any reason allowable under the law.
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-202(3): 31A-22-304 A motor vehicle liability policy may not be rescinded for fraud or material misrepresentation, as to minimum liability coverage limits under Section


Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-203 Notice and proof of loss.

Section

Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-204 Restriction on limitation of coverage.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
No insurer may limit coverage under a policy insuring against legal liability to claims that are first made against the insured while the policy is in force, unless the policy contains on the cover page, a conspicuous statement that the coverage of the policy is limited in that way.

Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-205 Applicability of restatement of law.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 31A-22-205(1): A restatement of the law of liability insurance is not the law or public policy of this state if the statement of law is inconsistent or in conflict with:
