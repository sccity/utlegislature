Utah Code Annotated - Title 35A - Chapter 4 - Employment Security Act
*********************************************************************

Utah Code Annotated § 35A-4-101 Title.
--------------------------------------
This chapter is known as the "Employment Security Act."

Utah Code Annotated § 35A-4-102 Public policy -- General welfare requires creation of unemployment reserves -- Employment offices.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a guide to the interpretation and application of this  chapter, the public policy of this state is declared to be as follows: Economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of the people of this state.  Unemployment is therefore a subject of general interest and concern that requires appropriate action by the Legislature to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden which now so often falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker and his family.  The achievement of social security requires protection against this greatest hazard of our economic life.  This objective can be furthered by operating free public employment offices in affiliation with a nation-wide system of employment services, by devising appropriate methods for reducing the volume of unemployment and by the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment from which benefits may be paid for periods of unemployment, thus maintaining purchasing power and limiting the serious social consequences of unemployment.  The Legislature, therefore, declares that in its considered judgment the public good, and the general welfare of the citizens of this state require the enactment of this measure, under the police power of the state, for the establishment and maintenance of free public employment offices and for the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to be used for the benefit of unemployed persons.
