Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-1 Declaration of policy.
----------------------------------------------------
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, the public policy of this state is declared as follows:Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-1(1): It is not unlawful for employees to organize themselves into or carry on labor unions for the purpose of lessening hours of labor, increasing wages, bettering the conditions of members, or carrying out the legitimate purposes of such organizations as freely as they could do if acting singly.
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-1(2): The labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce.  Nothing contained in the antitrust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence and operation of labor, agricultural or horticultural organizations, instituted for the purpose of mutual help and not having capital stock or conducted for profit, or to forbid or restrain individual members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate object thereof; nor shall such organizations or membership in them be held to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade under the antitrust laws.
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-1(3): Negotiations of terms and conditions of labor should result from voluntary agreement between employer and employee.  Governmental authority has permitted and encouraged employers to organize in the corporate and other forms of capital control.  In dealing with such employers the individual unorganized worker is helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract and to protect the individual unorganized worker's freedom of labor and thereby to obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment.  Therefore, it is necessary that the individual employee have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of the individual employee's own choosing to negotiate the terms and conditions of the individual employee's employment, and that the individual employee shall be free from the interference, restraint or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or their mutual aid or protection.


Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-2 Injunctive relief prohibited in certain cases.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
No court, nor any judge or judges of it, shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction which in specific or general terms prohibits any person or persons from doing, whether singly or in concert, any of the following acts:Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-2(1): ceasing or refusing to perform any work or to remain in any relation of employment regardless of any promise, undertaking, contract or agreement to do such work or to remain in such employment;
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-2(2): 34-19-3 becoming or remaining a member of any labor organization or of any employer organization, regardless of any such undertaking or promise as is described in Section
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-2(3): paying or giving to or withholding from any person any strike or unemployment benefits or insurance or other money or things of value;
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-2(4): by all lawful means aiding any person who is being proceeded against in or is prosecuting any action or suit in any court of the United States or of any state;
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-2(5): giving publicity to and obtaining or communicating information regarding the existence of or the facts involved in any dispute, whether by advertising, speaking, patrolling any public street or any place where any person or persons may lawfully be, without intimidation or coercion, or by any other method not involving fraud, violence, breach of the peace, or threat of same;
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-2(6): ceasing to patronize or to employ any person or persons;
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-2(7): assembling peaceably to do or to organize to do any of the acts heretofore specified or to promote lawful interests;

Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-2(10): 34-19-3 advising, urging, or inducing without fraud, violence, or threat of same, others to do the acts heretofore specified, regardless of any such undertaking or promise as is described in Section

Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-2(12): doing in concert any or all of the acts heretofore specified on the ground that the persons engaged therein constitute an unlawful combination or conspiracy.


Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-3 Liability of organizations or their members for unlawful acts of individuals.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No officer or member of any association or organization or no association or organization participating or interested in a labor dispute shall be held responsible or liable in any civil action at law or suit in equity, or in any criminal prosecution, for the unlawful acts of individual officers, members, or agents, except upon proof by the weight of evidence and without the aid of any presumptions of law or fact, both of:Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-3(1): the doing of such acts by persons who are officers, members or agents of any such association or organization; and
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-3(2): actual participation in, or actual authorization of, such acts, or ratification of such acts after actual knowledge thereof by such association or organization.


Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-4 Injunctive relief -- Reasons for prohibiting.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equity procedure that permits a complaining party to obtain sweeping injunctive relief that is not preceded by or conditioned upon notice to and hearing of the responding party or parties, or that issues after hearing based upon written affidavits alone and not wholly or in part upon examination, confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses in open court, is peculiarly subject to abuse in labor litigation for the reasons that:Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-4(1): The status quo cannot be maintained but is necessarily altered by the injunction;
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-4(2): Determination of issues of veracity and/or probability of fact from affidavits of the opposing parties that are contradictory and, under the circumstances, untrustworthy rather than from oral examination in open court is subject to grave error;
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-4(3): Error in issuing the injunctive relief is usually irreparable to the opposing party; and
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-4(4): Delay incident to the normal course of appellate practice frequently makes ultimate correction of error in law or in fact unavailing in the particular case.


Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-5 Injunctive relief -- When available -- Necessary findings -- Procedure.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-5(1): 34-19-11; (2) No court, nor any judge or judges of a court, shall have jurisdiction to issue a temporary or permanent injunction in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, as defined in Section
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-5(2): (1); 34-19-2 The findings required by Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-5(2)(a): that unlawful acts have been threatened or committed and will be executed or continued unless restrained;

Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-5(2)(c): that as to each item of relief granted greater injury will be inflicted upon complainant by the denial of it than will be inflicted upon defendants by the granting of it;
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-5(2)(d): 34-19-2 that no item of relief granted is relief that a court or judge of it has no jurisdiction to restrain or enjoin under Section
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-5(2)(e): that the complainant has no adequate remedy at law; and
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-5(2)(f): that the public officers charged with the duty to protect complainant's property have failed or are unable to furnish adequate protection.
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-5(3): (4); (1) Subject to Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-5(4):

This order to show cause shall be served upon such party or parties as are sought to be restrained and as shall be specified in the order, and the restraining order shall issue only upon testimony, or in the discretion of the court, upon affidavits, sufficient, if sustained, to justify the court in issuing a temporary injunction upon a hearing as provided for in this section.
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-5(4)(b): Such a temporary restraining order shall be effective for no longer than five days, and at the expiration of said five days shall become void and not subject to renewal or extension, except that if the hearing for a temporary injunction shall have been begun before the expiration of the five days, the restraining order may in the court's discretion be continued until a decision is reached upon the issuance of the temporary injunction.
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-5(5): (5) No temporary restraining order or temporary injunction shall be issued except on condition that the complainant shall first file an undertaking with adequate security sufficient to recompense those enjoined for any loss, expense, or damage caused by the improvident or erroneous issuance of such order or injunction, including all reasonable costs, together with reasonable attorney fees, and expense against the order or against the granting of any injunctive relief sought in the same proceeding and subsequently denied by the court.  This undertaking shall be understood to signify an agreement entered into by the complainant and the surety upon which a decree may be rendered in the same suit or proceeding against such complainant and surety, the complainant and the surety submitting themselves to the jurisdiction of the court for that purpose, except that nothing in this Subsection


Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-6 Injunctive relief -- Compliance with law necessary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No restraining order or injunctive relief shall be granted to any complainant who has failed to comply with any obligation imposed by law which is involved in the labor dispute in question, or who has failed to make every reasonable effort to settle such dispute either by negotiation or with the aid of any available machinery of governmental mediation or voluntary arbitration, but nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require the court to await the action of any such tribunal if irreparable injury is threatened.

Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-7 Injunctive relief -- Findings of fact -- Limited application.

Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-8 Injunctive relief -- Appeals.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Whenever any court, or judge or judges of it, shall issue or deny any temporary injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, the court shall, upon the request of any party to the proceedings, and on his filing the usual bond for costs, forthwith certify the entire record of the case, including a transcript of the evidence taken, to the appropriate appellate court for its review. Upon the filing of such record in the appropriate appellate court the appeal shall be heard with the greatest possible expedition, giving the proceeding precedence over all other matters except older matters of the same character.

Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-9 Injunctive relief -- Contempt -- Rights of accused.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In all cases where a person shall be charged with indirect criminal contempt for violation of a restraining order or injunction issued by a court, or judge or judges of it, the accused shall enjoy:Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-9(1): the rights as to admission to bail that are accorded to persons accused of crime;
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-9(2): the right to be notified of the accusation and a reasonable time to make a defense, provided the alleged contempt is not committed in the immediate view of or in the presence of the court;
Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-9(3): upon demand, the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the judicial district in which the contempt shall have been committed.

Utah Code Annotated § 34-19-9(4): the right to file with the court a demand for the retirement of the judge sitting in the proceeding, if the contempt arises from an attack upon the character or conduct of such judge and if the attack occurred otherwise than in open court.

********************************************************************************************

Utah Code Annotated § 34-20-1 Declaration of policy.
----------------------------------------------------
The public policy of the state as to employment relations and collective bargaining in the furtherance of which this chapter is enacted, is declared to be as follows:Utah Code Annotated § 34-20-1(1): It recognizes that there are three major interests involved, namely: that of the public, the employee, and the employer. These three interests are to a considerable extent interrelated. It is the policy of the state to protect and promote each of these interests with due regard to the situation and to the rights of the others.
Utah Code Annotated § 34-20-1(2): Industrial peace, regular and adequate income for the employee, and uninterrupted production of goods and services are promotive of all of these interests. They are largely dependent upon the maintenance of fair, friendly, and mutually satisfactory employment relations and the availability of suitable machinery for the peaceful adjustment of whatever controversies may arise. It is recognized that certain employers, including farmers and farmer cooperatives, in addition to their general employer problems, face special problems arising from perishable commodities and seasonal production which require adequate consideration. It is also recognized that whatever may be the rights of disputants with respect to each other in any controversy regarding employment relations, they should not be permitted in the conduct of their controversy to intrude directly into the primary rights of third parties to earn a livelihood, transact business, and engage in the ordinary affairs of life by any lawful means and free from molestation, interference, restraint, or coercion.
Utah Code Annotated § 34-20-1(3): Negotiation of terms and conditions of work should result from voluntary agreement between employer and employee.

Utah Code Annotated § 34-20-1(4): It is the policy of the state, in order to preserve and promote the interests of the public, the employee, and the employer alike, to establish standards of fair conduct in employment relations and to provide a convenient, expeditious and impartial tribunal by which these interests may have their respective rights and obligations adjudicated.
