Utah Code Annotated § 54-8-20 Assessments -- Failure to pay installment -- Interest and penalties -- Lien on property -- Sale of property -- Disposition of proceeds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The failure to pay any installment and any interest thereon when due shall ipso facto cause all other installments and the interest thereon to become due and payable and the governing body shall, within 30 days from the date of such default, proceed against the property for the collection of the total amount due thereon, including interest plus 10% additional on unpaid principal and interest as penalties and costs of collection. Special assessments levied hereunder shall rank on an equality with taxes levied against the property assessed by the state, the county and all other taxing districts, and no sale of property for the nonpayment of taxes or other special assessments shall extinguish the lien of other than the taxes or special assessments for the nonpayment of which such sale is had. The proceeds of the sale of any property for nonpayment of special assessments shall be applied in the discharge of such assessments, the interest thereon, costs and penalties. If there are outstanding any special improvement bonds issued pursuant to the improvement in question, proceeds of the sale of any property for nonpayment of any special assessments shall after the payment therefrom of the costs of collection be applied to the costs of redemption prior to maturity of as many of the outstanding special improvement bonds as can be retired with the amount available. Any surplus remaining after the payment of amounts due shall be paid over to the owner of the property sold. The lien of special assessments levied hereunder shall be superior to all other liens against the property assessed except that it shall be on a parity with the lien of ad valorem taxes and a lien of other special assessments and shall be effective from and after the date upon which the resolution levying the assessments is adopted.

Utah Code Annotated § 54-8-21 Assessments -- Prepayment of unpaid installments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The governing body may in the resolution levying the assessments provide that all unpaid installments of assessments levied against any piece of property may (but only in their entirety) be paid prior to the dates on which they become due if the property owner paying such installments pays all interest which would accrue thereon to the next succeeding date on which interest is payable on the bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of the assessments, together with such additional amount of interest as in the opinion of the governing body is necessary to assure the availability of money fully sufficient to pay interest on the bonds as interest becomes due and any redemption premiums which may become payable on the bonds in order to retire in advance of maturity bonds in a sufficient amount to utilize the assessments thus paid in advance. If no bonds have been issued then all unpaid installments of assessments levied against any piece of property may be paid in their entirety prior to the date upon which they become due by paying the principal amount due and the interest accrued thereon to the date of payment.

Utah Code Annotated § 54-8-22 Bonds -- Issuance authorized -- Amount -- Interest -- Additional requirements.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the expiration of 30 days from the date of the adoption of the resolution levying the assessments, the county legislative body may issue negotiable interest-bearing bonds in a principal amount not exceeding the unpaid balance of the assessments levied.  The bonds shall bear interest at not exceeding 7% per annum, payable semiannually or annually, and shall mature serially over a period not exceeding 20 years, but in no event shall such bonds extend over a longer period of time than the period of time over which such installments of special assessments are due and payable and 90 days thereafter.  The bonds shall be of such form and denomination and shall be payable in principal and interest at such times and place, and shall be sold, authorized, and issued in such manner as the county legislative body may determine.  The bonds shall be dated no earlier than the date on which the special assessment shall begin to bear interest, and shall be secured by and payable from the irrevocable pledge and dedication of the funds derived from the levy and collection of the special assessments in anticipation of the collection of which they are issued.  Any premium received on the sale of the bonds may be applied as other bond proceeds or if not so applied the same shall be placed in the fund for the payment of principal of and interest on the bonds.  The bonds shall be callable for redemption from the proceeds of any property sold for the nonpayment of special assessments but not otherwise unless the bonds on the face thereof provide for redemption prior to maturity, and the county legislative body may provide that the bonds shall be redeemable on any interest payment date or dates prior to maturity pursuant to such notice and at such premiums as it deems advisable.  The bonds shall be signed by the county executive and the chair of the county legislative body and shall be countersigned by the city recorder or the clerk of the board of the town trustees or the clerk of the county legislative body, whichever is applicable, and one of such signatures may be a facsimile signature.  Interest may be evidenced by interest coupons attached to such bonds and signed by a facsimile signature of one of the individuals who signed the bond.

Utah Code Annotated - Title 54 - Chapter 22 - Stray Current or Voltage Remediation Act
**************************************************************************************

Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101 Title -- Legislative findings.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(1): This chapter is known as the "Stray Current or Voltage Remediation Act."
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(2): The Legislature finds that:
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(2)(a): to protect livestock and livestock operations, it is necessary and appropriate to establish an actionable level of stray current and voltage that is safely below any level that is capable of harming livestock or adversely affecting the behavior, health, or productivity of livestock;
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(2)(b): the efficient, effective, and safe generation, transmission, and distribution of electrical energy by electric entities is critical to the well-being of the citizens and the economy of the state;
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(2)(c): permitting an electric entity to face liability based on a level of stray current or voltage that is incapable of adversely affecting livestock seriously threatens the efficient, effective, and safe generation, transmission, and distribution of electrical energy in the state, as well as the continuing viability of economic activity that depends on electrical energy;
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(2)(d): to guarantee the sufficient availability of efficient, effective, and safe electrical energy in the state, which requires the continuing operation of electric entities, it is necessary and appropriate for the Legislature to establish a uniform actionable level for an electric entity with respect to stray current and voltage and livestock; and
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(2)(e): because the actionable level is set sufficiently below any level that is capable of adversely affecting the behavior, health, or productivity of livestock, any potential of harm to livestock from stray current or voltage below this level is highly remote and unexpected.


Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-102 Definitions.
--------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-102(1): "Actionable level" means stray current or voltage that is:
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-102(1)(a): a steady-state, root mean square, alternating current (AC) of 2.0 milliamps or more through a 500 ohm resistor connected between livestock contact points, as measured by a digital true root mean square meter;
